# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

An interactive web-based dashboard to explore and visualize the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels.

## Background

The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs) are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare. This project creates an interactive dashboard to explore this dataset and visualize the top 10 OTUs found in each individual.

## Features

- Dropdown menu to select an individual sample
- Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual
- Bubble chart displaying all samples for the selected individual
- Display of the selected individual's demographic information
- Automatically updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected
- (Optional) Gauge chart displaying the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual

## Data Source
